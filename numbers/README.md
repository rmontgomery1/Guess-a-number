                                                    -Overview-  
This is a simple program called Numbers.  
The Numbers program will ask for ten numbers between zero and one-hundred. It will then take the lowest number, highest number, and
average the two together. It will then display those numbers to you explaining what numbers was 
choosen.

                                                    -Outline-  

This program has several different variables being initialized:

Number - This variable is to take a number in from the user.  
placeholder - This variable is used for calculating.  
lowest - is used to hold the lowest value.  
highest - This variable is used to hold the highest numbers.  
average - This variable is used to display the average. 

                                                  -Steps are sequential-
                                                  
1.) A print statement will then be produced stating exactly what the program will do.  
2.) A scanner will then be made so that the input of the values can be taken.   
3.) A for loop will start by stating that it will loop a counted 10 times.   
4.) Inside the loop a statement will be printed and a variable will be assigned to the scanner.  
5.) A while loop will be created with the condition that the number entered previously will be between 0 and 100.  
6.) After the loops the if statements will then sort out the highest number and lowest number from those
that was entered. 
7.) Three statements will then be displayed telling the user the lowest, highest and average number (respectively).  
8.) The program will then terminate.
